# SatelliteBench: A benchmark dataset for multi-modal fusion of multi-spectral satellite imagery for public health

Introducing SatelliteBench: a breakthrough overcoming data scarcity. With 12,636 aligned images and metadata from 81 Colombian municipalities (2016-2018), we use innovative methods, including Sentinel Hub and Google Earth Engine, for efficient embeddings using multi-modal fusion.

Our approach blends satellite imagery and metadata, outperforming traditional methods reliant on inaccessible historical data. From predicting disease outbreaks to resource allocation, SatelliteBench empowers reproducible research, especially in data-scarce regions.

Join us in reshaping research for better public health and development insights.
